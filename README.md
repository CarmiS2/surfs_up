# Surfs_up Analysis

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis 
 - The purpose of this analysis is to gather information about temperature trends in anticipation of a surf shop opening in Oahu. By utilizing tools for advanced data storage and retrieval we are able to efficiently pull temperature trends specifically in June and December. This will allow key stakeholders to make data driven decisions, such as, if an all year around surf and ice cream shops will be a suitable business model vs. seasonal.

## Results

- As shown above, we have the summary statistics for both the months of June and December.
### Key Differences 
- In the month of June in Oahu, Hawaii the average temperature is 75 F and in December the average is 71 F. That is only a 4 degree difference.
- it's also worth noting that the max temperature recorded for June and December is only a 2 degree difference. Max temperature in June is 85 degrees F and December is 83 degrees F. 
- Last key difference is the minimum temperature in June (64) and December (56). With December reaching much lower temperature ice cream and surfing would most likely not be the most popular shop on these days in winter. However, looking at the standard deviation in December being larger we could expect more variation in December.  

## Summary 
- Overall looking at the data we have presented, based on historical temperatures with the max and mean temperature between June and December being so close in degrees. I can safely recommend a surf/ice cream shop. 

### For further analysis for this project, I would recommend the below queries.
Pulling and comparing data for participation in this area between summer vs winter. Rain can deter customers from surfing and ice cream 
For more information where locally may be the best area to lease space for the shop, I would recommend a query to break down that analyzes the temperature difference in weather stations in the area.
